# AXTP Spec Changelog

This changelog records AXTP Spec releases published with `spec/vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags.

Current repository path note: conformance cases now live at the root `conformance/` directory. Older release entries may mention their historical paths.

## spec/v0.13.0

NT10 source video encoder parameter control through the Nearcast cast flow-control surface.

### Protocol

- Adds `cast.setVideoStreamParams` under `cast.flowControl` so Nearcast can configure the current cast session's NT10/source encoder frame rate and bitrate.
- Defines coordinated active-stream replacement as `video.closeStream(reason=encodingReconfigure)` followed by `video.openStream(peerRole=transmitter)` with a new `streamId`; idle sources open directly.
- Keeps audio running, preserves the existing `syncGroupId`, and defines rollback to the previous parameters and stream when the replacement open fails.
- Defines parameter precedence as explicit `video.openStream` values, then current-session cast values, then source/profile defaults; omitted set fields remain unchanged and only `resetFields` clears them.

### Registry

- Adds `cast.setVideoStreamParams` as method `0x1614`, `bitOffset=19`, bound to the existing `cast.flowControl` capability and `cast.flowControlChanged` event.
- Extends cast flow-control capability and state metadata with video parameter support, active reconfiguration support, desired/effective encoder values, reconfiguration state, stream identifiers, rollback status, and diagnostics.
- Extends `video.stream` source, open, state, event, and close-reason facts with encoder frame-rate/bitrate capabilities and `encodingReconfigure` lifecycle metadata.
- Promotes `MEDIA_BITRATE_UNSUPPORTED` to the MVP error set and exposes it from the relevant cast/video methods.

### Schemas

- Adds `CastSetVideoStreamParamsParams`, `CastSetVideoStreamParamsResult`, and `CastVideoStreamParamsState`.
- Extends `CastFlowControlState`, `CastFlowControlChangedEvent`, `CastFlowControlCapability`, `VideoStreamSource`, `VideoStreamState`, and `VideoStreamStateChangedEvent` without changing existing field IDs.
- Treats zero encoder frame rate or bitrate as invalid; callers omit fields to preserve current values and use `resetFields` to restore source/profile defaults.

### Conformance

- Adds capability degradation coverage proving unsupported encoder control returns `NOT_SUPPORTED` without closing the AXTP session.
- Adds idle-open, active close/open replacement, explicit-open precedence, rollback, validation, and concurrent-`BUSY` cases.
- Expands the shared conformance manifest from 30 to 36 cases.

### Migration

- Existing runtimes remain compatible when they do not advertise `cast.flowControl.supportsVideoStreamParams`; registered-but-unavailable calls return `NOT_SUPPORTED`.
- Implementations that advertise the new fields must preserve session-local values, reject unsupported profile values with typed media errors, and serialize active reconfiguration operations.

### Runtime Impact

- `axtp-cpp-runtime` should bind to `spec/v0.13.0`, regenerate protocol metadata, implement or explicitly degrade `cast.setVideoStreamParams`, and run the new conformance cases.
- Existing CONTROL/RPC/STREAM framing and previously registered method, event, capability, and schema IDs remain backward compatible with `spec/v0.12.0`.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.12.0

Cast receiver audio delay compensation and event envelope clarification.

### Protocol

- Adds `cast.setAudioDelay` so receivers can configure local cast audio playback delay compensation, with `0` disabling compensation.
- Documents the intended receiver behavior: audio delay shifts local output timing only, does not change media cursors, and does not replace AV drift correction.
- Clarifies that JSON RPC event payload data does not repeat `sid`, while every event message still carries `sid` in the outer `sid/op/d` envelope.

### Registry

- Extends the generated `cast` domain with `cast.setAudioDelay` as method `0x1613`, `bitOffset=18`, request schema `CastSetAudioDelayParams`, response schema `CastAudioState`, and event `cast.audioChanged`.
- Updates `cast.audioChanged` metadata so delay changes are part of the event trigger surface.
- Preserves existing cast method IDs, event IDs, field IDs, and bit offsets for previously generated facts.

### Schemas

- Adds `CastSetAudioDelayParams.audioDelayMs:uint32` with range `0..1000`.
- Adds optional `CastAudioState.audioDelayMs` with default `250`.
- Adds `CastAudioCapability.supportsAudioDelay`, `defaultAudioDelayMs`, and `maxAudioDelayMs` capability fields.

### Conformance

- Does not add new hand-written conformance cases in this release.
- Generator build, generator tests, source validation, protocol validation, and generated protocol output checks cover the new registry and schema facts.

### Migration

- Cast runtimes may keep existing behavior if they do not advertise or implement audio delay support.
- Cast receivers that implement `cast.audio` should expose the configured delay through `CastAudioState.audioDelayMs` and clear runtime PCM delay buffers on stream open, close, device reopen, or format change.
- Event consumers should continue reading RPC `sid` from the outer event envelope, not from event `data`.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime and SDK teams should regenerate protocol metadata from `spec/v0.12.0` before exposing `cast.setAudioDelay` or the new cast audio capability fields.
- Existing CONTROL/RPC/STREAM wire layout, generated domains outside `cast`, shared errors, and previously generated cast facts remain backward compatible with `spec/v0.11.2`.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.11.2

Core RPC `sid` receiver compatibility patch.

### Protocol

- Clarifies that AXTP-native Logical Servers should continue generating `sid` values as non-zero `uint32` rendered as 8-character hex strings in JSON object encodings.
- Loosens JSON / CBOR / MSGPACK receiver requirements so assigned `sid` values are treated as opaque non-empty strings, allowing legacy or external session strings that are not 8-character hex.
- Keeps JSON_BINARY `sid` as a 4-byte Big-Endian `uint32`, with `0` reserved for the unassigned state.

### Registry

- Does not change registry YAML, generated method/event/capability facts, schema facts, profile facts, or stable IDs.

### Schemas

- Does not change business schema definitions.

### Conformance

- Does not add new hand-written conformance cases in this release.
- Existing generator validation, protocol validation, generated drift checks, release artifact checks, and Markdown/link checks cover the clarified core text.

### Migration

- JSON runtimes and SDKs that previously rejected assigned `sid` strings only because they were not 8-character hex should preserve and match the returned non-empty string instead.
- AXTP-native servers may continue producing 8-character hex `sid` strings such as `"00000003"`.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime and SDK teams are not required to regenerate generated business protocol metadata for this patch, because machine-readable registry facts are unchanged.
- Existing CONTROL/RPC/STREAM wire layout, generated domains, shared errors, and business contract facts remain unchanged from `spec/v0.11.1`.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.11.1

Core RPC envelope clarification patch.

### Protocol

- Corrects the core RPC JSON RequestResponse example so `d.status` is an object carrying `status.ok` and `status.code` instead of a numeric shortcut.
- Clarifies that JSON / CBOR / MSGPACK RequestResponse envelopes MUST carry `status.ok` and `status.code`, while JSON_BINARY uses its fixed-header `statusCode:uint16` with the same semantics.
- Restores the explicit `sid` generation and encoding rules in the current core spec: `sid` is a `uint32`, JSON forms are fixed 8-character hex strings after Identified, `0` is reserved, and examples such as `"00000003"` are valid non-zero session IDs.

### Registry

- Does not change registry YAML, generated method/event/capability facts, schema facts, profile facts, or stable IDs.

### Schemas

- Does not change business schema definitions.

### Conformance

- Does not add new hand-written conformance cases in this release.
- Existing generator validation, protocol validation, generated drift checks, release artifact checks, and Markdown/link checks cover the corrected core text.

### Migration

- Runtime implementations that already use `status.ok` / `status.code` and fixed 8-character hex `sid` values do not need code changes.
- Implementations that copied the erroneous `status: 0` JSON example should emit the standard status object form.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime and SDK teams are not required to regenerate generated business protocol metadata for this patch, because machine-readable registry facts are unchanged.
- Existing CONTROL/RPC/STREAM wire layout, generated domains, shared errors, and `cast` contract facts remain unchanged from `spec/v0.11.0`.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.11.0

Cast receiver snapshot status and window schema simplification.

### Protocol

- Keeps AirPlay receiver name control in the `cast.session` surface through the existing `cast.getAirPlayName` and `cast.setAirPlayName` methods.
- Refines `cast.status` into a current snapshot query only: `cast.getStatus` remains the reconnect, initial-load, and event-loss recovery calibration entry point.
- Removes the draft `cast.statusChanged` aggregate event so continuous updates are represented by feature-specific cast events and clients can call `cast.getStatus` when they need to resynchronize.
- Simplifies `CastWindowState` by removing `previousNormalBounds` and `restoredBounds`; `bounds` is the single protocol field for the current window rectangle.
- Adds schema reference tables with requiredness, field IDs, types, constraints, and defaults to the generated cast protocol draft documents.

### Registry

- Updates `contract/registry/domains/cast/domain.yaml` and generated protocol outputs to remove one draft event, reducing the generated cast method/event facts from 31 to 30.
- Removes `CastStatusChangedEvent` and `supportsStatusChangedEvent` from the generated cast status contract.
- Preserves existing cast method IDs, event IDs, field IDs, and bit offsets for the retained generated surface; removed window field IDs `0x08` and `0x09` are not reused.

### Schemas

- Updates `CastStatus`, `CastGetStatusParams`, receiver/session/PIN status summaries, and `CastStatusCapability` descriptions to use snapshot terminology.
- Updates `CastWindowState` examples and schema references so get/set/event results all report the current window state shape through `bounds`.
- Keeps sensitive status redaction behavior as a draft review item while retaining `redacted` markers in the current snapshot schema.

### Conformance

- Does not add new hand-written conformance cases in this release.
- Generator validation, protocol validation, generated drift checks, protocol status checks, release artifact checks, and protocol snapshot tests cover the cast registry and generated output changes.

### Migration

- Cast runtimes and SDKs that previously consumed the draft `cast.statusChanged` event should stop advertising or subscribing to that event and use feature-specific events plus `cast.getStatus` for resynchronization.
- Cast clients should treat `CastWindowState.bounds` as the current rectangle and remove dependencies on `previousNormalBounds` or `restoredBounds`.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime and SDK teams should regenerate protocol metadata from `spec/v0.11.0` before exposing the revised cast status and window surfaces.
- Existing non-cast behavior, CONTROL/RPC/STREAM wire layout, shared errors, and generated domains outside `cast` are unchanged from `spec/v0.10.0`.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

- Extends `contract/registry/core/domain_registry.yaml` with the high-byte-to-domain map covering `device` (`0x01`), `signage` (`0x0D`), and `software` (`0x0E`), and maps the generator/validator high byte to each new domain.
- Adds new error codes `ENROLLMENT_CODE_EXPIRED` and `ENROLLMENT_CODE_ALREADY_USED` for device enrollment pairing flow.
- Promotes the domain registry to a generator-driven model so domain YAML sources feed generator validation and generated artifacts directly.
- Marks the signage, software, and device enrollment protocol drafts as generated and updates product domain status/health summaries to reflect the new generated method/event facts.

### Schemas

- Adds generated schemas for signage playlist config, capabilities, and item URL refresh, including playlist item descriptor and validation constraints.
- Adds generated schemas for software config payloads and update policy descriptors.
- Adds generated schemas for device enrollment pairing code, enrollment state, and enrollment state change payloads.

- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.9.0

Cast receiver protocol registry and generated contract expansion.

### Protocol

- Adds the `cast` business domain as a generated AXTP protocol surface for AirPlay/UxPlay receiver control.
- Adds generated cast methods for session state, AirPlay receiver name, local audio playback/mute, PIN protection, window state, backend status/restart, receiver-local flow control, and aggregate status.
- Adds generated cast events for incoming session, phase/state changes, started/stopped/failed sessions, audio/PIN/window/backend/flow-control/status changes, and PIN authentication notifications.

### Registry

- Registers the `0x16xx` business domain range for `cast` and maps the generator/validator high byte to the `cast` domain.
- Adds `contract/registry/domains/cast/domain.yaml` with 18 methods, 13 events, 7 capabilities, and the supporting cast schema set.
- Marks the cast protocol drafts as generated and updates product domain status/health summaries to reflect 31 generated cast method/event facts.

### Schemas

### Conformance

- Does not add new conformance cases in this release.
- Generator validation, protocol validation, generated drift checks, protocol status checks, and protocol snapshot tests cover the new generated registry surface.

### Migration

- Existing runtimes remain compatible with earlier `spec/v0.8.x` contracts if they do not advertise or implement cast capabilities.

- Does not change registry YAML, Protocol IR, generated references, MCP artifacts, test vectors, or conformance case behavior.

### Documentation

- Normalizes frontstage documentation to Chinese-first wording across the docs reading route, role guides, product domain status, roadmap, and protocol draft health report while preserving protocol terms, paths, IDs, and implementation anchors.
- Refreshes `docs/product/protocol-draft-health.md` as a release artifact-safe product summary that exposes domain-level health counts without listing backstage `workspace/protocol/**` draft paths.
- Keeps file-level draft health analysis available through the local report script `--json` mode for maintainers who need backstage queues.

### Release Governance

- Adds `tooling/scripts/check-frontstage-language.mjs` to guard frontstage Chinese-first navigation language and prevent concrete backstage workspace paths from leaking into release artifact product pages.

- Removes generic protocol draft field placeholders such as repeated `sections`, `constraints`, empty `state` result descriptions, and repeated adoption-placeholder wording while preserving every method request/success example.
- Rewrites draft result tables so `target`, `state`, `sampledAt`, and formerly vague result rows carry sample values, concrete field summaries, or field-specific descriptions.
- Moves repeated schema-adoption guidance into `workspace/protocol/draft-conventions.md` so draft bodies stay focused on feature-specific params, results, events, capability fields, legacy mapping, and review questions.
- Refreshes `docs/product/protocol-draft-health.md` with `Generic field placeholders` tracking so maintainers can see that method examples remain complete and placeholder text stays at zero.

- Preserves CONTROL OPEN/ACCEPT, RPC, and STREAM examples in `specs/20-core.md` so runtime teams still have executable wire guidance after the docs slimming pass.

### Documentation

- Runtime and SDK teams should bind to `spec/v0.8.1` if they need the flattened `specs/**` layout or the verified cpp-runtime dispatch path.
- Implementations already compatible with `spec/v0.8.0` do not need wire-level, registry, SDK API, or conformance behavior changes for this release.
- Tooling that validates human-readable spec facts should read `specs/20-core.md` and `specs/40-codec.md`, with old nested paths treated only as historical archive material.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.8.0

Repository contract layout and release artifact boundary release.

### Protocol

- Keeps AXTP wire, session, RPC, STREAM, method, event, schema, and error semantics unchanged from `spec/v0.7.0`.
- Promotes the current machine-readable contract paths as the implementation authority: `contract/protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml`, `contract/generated/**`, `contract/registry/**`, `contract/mcp/**`, and `contract/test-vectors/**`.
- Keeps human-readable normative specs under root `specs/**` so runtime and SDK teams can separate implementation rules from maintainer workbench material.

### Registry

- Moves registry source facts to `contract/registry/**` and updates generator, validation, release, and workflow references to consume that path.
- Does not add, remove, or renumber adopted registry methods, events, capabilities, profiles, schemas, or error codes in this release.
- Updates protocol metadata references so generated artifacts point to the root `workspace/**` maintainer inputs rather than removed docs-hosted workspace paths.

### Schemas

- Refreshes generated protocol JSON/YAML metadata and generator snapshots for the new contract/workspace path model.
- Keeps generated Protocol IR structure and field semantics compatible with `spec/v0.7.0`; changes are path and release-boundary metadata only.
- Keeps MCP and test-vector artifacts inside `contract/` as part of the runtime-consumable release contract.

### Conformance

- Keeps conformance as a root-level testing entry point at `conformance/**`, independent from maintainer `workspace/**`.
- Adds plain-text path validation for maintainer draft and legacy evidence references so stale hidden paths fail before release.
- Extends protocol status validation to check generated and draft counts in `docs/product/domain-status.md`.

### Migration

- Moves maintainer workbench material to root `workspace/**`.
- Moves release operation documents to root `release/**`.
- Keeps historical audits in `docs/archive/**` and keeps legacy evidence in `workspace/legacy-migration/evidence/**`, but excludes those maintainer-only inputs from the default release artifact.

### Release Governance

- Tightens the default release artifact to include only `contract/`, `specs/`, `conformance/`, `docs/guides/`, `docs/product/`, root `release/`, and top-level release metadata.
- Excludes `workspace/business`, `workspace/flows`, `workspace/protocol`, `workspace/legacy-migration`, lifecycle skills, release templates, and legacy evidence from the published artifact.
- Updates release scripts, manifest template, CODEOWNERS, CI references, and lifecycle skill instructions to the new `contract/`, `tooling/`, `workspace/`, `conformance/`, and `release/` paths.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime and SDK teams should bind to `spec/v0.8.0` when they need the new release artifact layout and root `conformance/**` packaging.
- Implementations already compatible with `spec/v0.7.0` protocol facts do not need wire-level or API behavior changes for this release.
- Tooling that previously consumed `docs/generated/**`, `protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml`, `registry/**`, `tooling/mcp/**`, or `tooling/test-vectors/**` from the spec repository must update to the `contract/**` paths.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.7.0

Release contract, generated artifact governance, and Protocol IR fidelity release.

### Protocol

- Promotes capability metadata into top-level Protocol IR so runtimes and SDK generators can consume capability ids, status, type, and schema bindings directly.
- Preserves field defaults, enum values, schema references, repeated metadata, and array item typing in generated Protocol IR and JSON references.
- Converts generated-domain JSON-array fields from opaque `bytes` placeholders into first-class `array<T>` schema facts for device, firmware, network, audio stream, and video stream contracts.

### Registry

- Updates adopted domain YAML sources to express object arrays and scalar arrays with `type: array` plus `schema` or `array.item_type`.
- Adds source validation for array item type references so malformed array declarations fail before generated artifacts drift.

### Schemas

- Refreshes `contract/protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml`, `contract/generated/protocol.md`, `contract/generated/protocol.json`, MCP schema output, and generator snapshots from the richer contract/registry/source model.
- Keeps the remaining opaque `bytes` field only where the value is intentionally a polymorphic JSON selector rather than a simple array.

### Conformance

- Replaces loose conformance case validation with AJV-backed JSON Schema validation for case and result files.
- Adds cross-reference checks for manifest levels, profiles, fixtures, methods, events, errors, and capabilities.
- Keeps existing conformance behavior intact while making case authoring failures fail in CI.

### Release Governance

- Defines the release artifact as an explicit runtime-consumable contract containing `contract/protocol/`, `contract/generated/`, `contract/registry/`, `specs/`, `conformance/`, `contract/mcp`, `contract/test-vectors`, and `LICENSE`.
- Excludes `.DS_Store`, legacy evidence files, and repository-only lifecycle skills from the published archive.
- Adds generated drift, Markdown link, protocol status, and release artifact dry-run checks to CI and release validation.
- Adds repository governance entry points: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `CODEOWNERS`.

### Documentation

- Updates the protocol domain matrix to match generated method/event counts.
- Fixes generated protocol draft status text for adopted device, network, audio stream, video stream, and firmware update features.
- Fixes local Markdown links and clarifies renamed or merged draft paths.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime and SDK teams should bind to `spec/v0.7.0` and regenerate from `contract/protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml` or `contract/generated/protocol.json`.
- Generators should treat `array<T>`, field defaults, enum values, and top-level capability records as authoritative.
- Implementations that previously treated generated JSON-array fields as opaque bytes should update bindings to typed arrays where the new IR declares `type: array`.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.6.1

Core session field cleanup and CONTROL negotiation clarification release.

### Protocol

- Makes RPC `axtpVersion` the AXTP v1 compatibility authority and demotes `rpcVersion` / `negotiatedRpcVersion` to rc1 transition compatibility only.
- Adds required Identify `randomSeed:uint32` so devices without reliable clocks or hardware RNG can mix caller-provided entropy into RPC `sid` generation.
- Clarifies CONTROL `protocolVersion` as Deprecated/Transition and keeps Frame Header `Version` plus RPC `axtpVersion` as the primary version boundaries.
- Clarifies CONTROL sizing: `maxFrameSize` is the complete Standard Frame size limit, while `maxPayloadSize` is deprecated/reserved and `mtu` is profile-specific optional.

### Registry

- Updates core RPC op descriptions and protocol lifecycle metadata to reference `randomSeed` and AXTP version semantics.
- Updates CONTROL schema facts so `protocolVersion` is optional/deprecated, `mtu` is optional, and `maxFrameSize` has the minimum needed for the smallest CONTROL payload.

### Schemas

- Refreshes `contract/protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml`, generated protocol references, MCP schema output, and generator snapshots from the updated registry and schema facts.
- Keeps deprecated transition fields represented in generated artifacts for compatibility while removing them from new minimal handshake examples.

### Conformance

- Updates session and event conformance cases to require Identify `randomSeed:uint32`.
- Refreshes guides and testing quickstarts so WebSocket JSON and Standard Framed examples use the current Hello / Identify / Identified shape.

### Migration

- Updates legacy migration planning notes and cast receiver flow examples to use `randomSeed` and the revised RPC session startup shape.
- Leaves historical legacy evidence unchanged.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime and SDK teams should bind to `spec/v0.6.1`, accept missing `rpcVersion` in AXTP v1 handshakes, require `randomSeed:uint32` in Identify, and generate `sid` by mixing that seed with local state.
- Standard Framed runtimes should treat `maxFrameSize` as the peer receive limit for complete frames and should not require CONTROL `protocolVersion`, `maxPayloadSize`, or core `mtu` in new v1 handshakes.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.6.0

Business registry expansion and generated protocol refresh release.

### Protocol

- Expands the generated Protocol IR from the previously adopted audio algorithm surface to 38 methods, 17 events, 154 errors, 135 schemas, and 2 profiles.
- Generates newly adopted business protocol surfaces for `device.info`, `network.interface`, `network.ip`, `network.wifi`, `network.ap`, `audio.stream`, `video.stream`, and the P0 subset of `firmware.update`.
- Refreshes `contract/protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml`, `contract/generated/protocol.md`, `contract/generated/protocol.json`, generated registry markdown, MCP JSON registry artifacts, and generator snapshots from contract/registry/domain YAML sources.
- Keeps AXTP core wire semantics unchanged from `spec/v0.5.1`, including Big-Endian / network byte order.

### Registry

- Adds domain registry source files for `device`, `network`, `video`, and `firmware`.
- Extends the existing `audio` domain registry with `audio.stream` methods, events, schemas, and capability metadata.
- Marks the adopted protocol drafts as generated while preserving unresolved `[REVIEW-ASK]` items as non-contract review notes.
- Keeps legacy mappings unadopted where field-level behavior remains unconfirmed.

### Schemas

- Adds generated schema coverage for device information snapshots, network interface/IP/Wi-Fi/AP configuration and state, audio/video stream control, stream state events, and firmware update sessions.
- Adds capability descriptors for `device.info`, `network.interface`, `network.ip`, `network.wifi`, `network.ap`, `audio.stream`, `video.stream`, and `firmware.update`.
- Keeps advanced firmware update flows such as cancel, resume, URL update, rollback, and external verify/install out of the generated P0 contract.

### Conformance

- Updates generator tests and protocol snapshots so validation tracks the expanded generated protocol model.
- Source and generated protocol validation now pass against the 38-method / 17-event registry model.
- No new hand-written conformance cases are added in this release; domain-specific conformance suites should follow the generated facts.

### Migration

- Preserves legacy review notes in the adopted protocol drafts but does not promote unconfirmed legacy aliases into stable registry mappings.
- Keeps adapter-only or uncertain legacy behavior outside the generated implementation contract.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime and SDK teams should bind to `spec/v0.6.0`, regenerate from `contract/protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml` or `contract/generated/protocol.json`, and update method/event/capability registries accordingly.
- Existing `spec/v0.5.1` core wire behavior remains compatible; this release primarily expands generated business registry facts.
- Implementations should treat generated `draft` business methods as adopted registry facts for this snapshot, while using capability discovery before invoking optional device/network/stream/firmware features.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.5.1

Wire byte order metadata and runtime release hotfix.

### Protocol

- Adds machine-readable `wire` metadata to the Protocol IR with `byteOrder: big-endian`, `byteOrderAlias: network`, and `crcByteOrder: big-endian`.
- Emits the same wire byte order facts into `contract/generated/protocol.json` and `contract/generated/protocol.md`.
- Updates generator validation so Protocol IR and core specs must continue to agree on Big-Endian / network byte order.

### Conformance

- Updates Standard Framed test vectors to use Big-Endian / network byte order for frame length, message id, RPC method/event ids, and STREAM header fields.
- Adds a STREAM conformance byte-order assertion for `streamId:uint32`, `seqId:uint32`, and `cursor:uint64`.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime repositories should bind to `spec/v0.5.1` rather than `spec/v0.5.0` for Standard Framed binary work.
- Runtime wire codecs must serialize and parse AXTP multi-byte wire integers using Big-Endian / network byte order.
- Runtime vendored generator templates and generated protocol references should no longer mention Little-Endian for AXTP wire integers.

## spec/v0.5.0

Documentation governance, business protocol draft consolidation, and AXTP network byte order alignment release.

### Protocol

- Establishes a clearer repository narrative and role-based documentation entry points for first-time readers, runtime/SDK implementers, conformance owners, protocol maintainers, product/architecture reviewers, legacy migration owners, and release owners.
- Adds a shared AXTP glossary and refactors `specs/**` into a more normative core/contract/registry/codec/tooling specification backbone.
- Rewrites core runtime specs for Frame/Payload, Transport Profiles, CONTROL, RPC, STREAM, and low-bandwidth degradation to separate required v1 behavior from optional/future behavior.
- Aligns AXTP multi-byte wire fields to Big-Endian / network byte order across specs, guides, and STREAM draft examples. Runtime implementations that followed earlier Little-Endian draft text must update frame, CONTROL, RPC JSON_BINARY, TLV, STREAM, and CRC byte handling.
- Updates flow and protocol-draft templates so business flows identify protocol coverage/gaps, and domain-feature drafts use readable method/event overview plus per-item schema expansion.
- Adds or refines draft business protocol documents for device information, system state/lifecycle/reset, device enrollment/child devices, signage management, software config/update policy, firmware update policy, and audio/video stream-related drafts.

### Registry

- No registry YAML source facts are changed in this release.
- Keeps adopted runtime contract facts sourced from `contract/registry/**`, `contract/protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml`, and `contract/generated/**`.
- Moves historical registry planning tables into non-normative appendix documents under `workspace/registry-planning/candidates/**`; runtimes must not implement from these appendix tables.
- Clarifies domain.feature naming, method/event/error/profile allocation rules, draft ID boundaries, and registry adoption readiness criteria.

### Schemas

- No adopted generated schema contract changes are introduced by this release.
- Refines protocol draft schema presentation for audio.algorithm, audio.eq, audio.volume, device.info, system.state, system.lifecycle, system.reset, signage, software, and related draft modules.
- Clarifies that draft methodId, eventId, errorCode, capabilityId, and fieldId values remain registry-assigned or intentionally unassigned until adoption.

### Conformance

- Expands conformance documentation into a clearer main entry, runtime checklist, support-level guidance, failure classification, and Phase 1 MVP expectations.
- Adds audit material and module review checklists for future business-domain conformance planning.
- Existing conformance cases remain the source for runtime validation; draft business protocol documents do not become conformance requirements until adopted and generated.

### Migration

- Adds and updates flow documents for device/system, signage device management, cast receiver/pairing, firmware update, audio/video streaming, and audio algorithm control scenarios.
- Preserves legacy migration evidence while moving new protocol decisions into flows and protocol drafts.
- Clarifies that legacy aliases and adapter-only behavior must not pollute formal domain.feature boundaries.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime and SDK teams should bind to `spec/v0.5.0`, the exact commit, or the generated release artifact; they must not depend on floating `main`.
- Standard Framed binary runtimes must treat AXTP multi-byte wire integers as Big-Endian / network byte order for new work against this release.
- WebSocket JSON behavior remains RPC-oriented; CONTROL and STREAM remain Standard Framed concerns.
- Business protocol documents under `workspace/protocol/**` are review drafts unless backed by registry YAML and generated artifacts.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.0.4

Spec repository purification, documentation workflow, and Phase 1 STREAM data-plane alignment release.

### Protocol

- Reorganizes the main repository as a protocol-first spec repository with root runtime leftovers removed and runtime source/docs moved out of the AXTP spec tree.
- Groups the formal `specs/` corpus into core, registry, codec, and tooling sections to make the protocol reading path easier to follow.
- Aligns Phase 1 CONTROL scope to `OPEN / ACCEPT`, `HEARTBEAT / HEARTBEAT_ACK`, and `CLOSE / CLOSE_ACK`; ACK/NACK remains reserved for future reliable-transfer profiles.
- Aligns Standard Framed transports to support CONTROL, RPC, and Phase 1 STREAM data packets for adopted audio/video media stream profiles.
- Clarifies RPC encoding order and semantics: `JSON`, `CBOR`, `MSGPACK`, and `JSON_BINARY`; `bodyEncoding` applies only to `JSON_BINARY` with `NONE`, `TLV8`, and `TLV16`.
- Adds and refines onboarding docs including `KICKOFF.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, core protocol flow, quickstart, and runtime MVP/conformance guidance.

### Registry

- Updates protocol metadata, transport capability declarations, control opcode status, RPC encoding facts, body encoding facts, and `protocol.payload.stream` capability status to match the Phase 1 decisions.
- Refreshes `contract/protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml`, generated protocol references, generator snapshots, and MCP/tooling registry outputs from the YAML source facts.
- Keeps adopted business methods limited to the current generated `audio.algorithm` surface while documenting that video/audio stream business methods must be adopted before becoming a published runtime contract.

### Schemas

- No breaking schema shape changes are introduced for adopted business methods.
- Refreshes generated schema references and snapshots as part of the source-to-generated validation pipeline.
- Clarifies `sid`, `requestId`, `rpcEncoding`, `bodyEncoding`, and STREAM header typing in the core specs and generated references.

### Conformance

- Moves conformance into the `docs/conformance/**` documentation hierarchy and keeps release artifacts compatible by packaging conformance at the artifact root.
- Updates conformance manifest and framed-binary/stream profiles so Standard Framed runtime MVP covers CONTROL open/heartbeat/close, RPC request matching, and media STREAM open/data/close semantics.
- Revises STREAM conformance cases to model media stream lifecycle through business-domain methods such as `video.openStream` / `video.closeStream` instead of requiring generic `stream.open` / `stream.close`.
- Keeps ACK/NACK strict retransmission outside Phase 1 conformance requirements.

### Migration

- Consolidates legacy evidence, classification, plans, generated outputs, and planning docs under `workspace/legacy-migration/**`.
- Updates legacy classification and migration tooling paths to the new docs layout.
- Preserves legacy migration guidance while keeping legacy adapters outside the AXTP Core wire contract.

### Runtime Impact

- Standard Framed runtimes should treat STREAM as a Phase 1 P0 data-plane requirement for adopted audio/video media stream profiles.
- WebSocket JSON remains RPC-only and does not carry CONTROL or STREAM payloads.
- Runtime conformance scripts should prefer `$AXTP_SPEC_PATH/docs/conformance` and may retain `$AXTP_SPEC_PATH/conformance` fallback for release artifact compatibility.
- Runtime and SDK teams should continue to bind to a fixed `spec/v0.0.4` tag or commit through their spec lock metadata; no runtime package release is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.0.3

Conformance foundation release for AXTP Spec and runtime/tool repositories.

### Protocol

- No wire protocol fact changes from `spec/v0.0.2`.
- Keeps current `spec/v0.0.2` method and event names, including `audio.getAlgorithmConfig`, `audio.setAlgorithmConfig`, `audio.getAlgorithmCapabilities`, and `audio.algorithmConfigChanged`.
- Keeps capability discovery out of the wire-level conformance surface because current protocol docs reserve `capability.getAll` for v2/P1.

### Registry

- No registry ID or method/event fact changes from `spec/v0.0.2`.
- Treats capability conformance as generated registry and capability metadata validation against the existing registry facts.

### Schemas

- Adds conformance case and result JSON schemas under `docs/conformance/schemas/`.
- Keeps existing protocol and business schema facts unchanged.

### Conformance

- Adds the first AXTP conformance manifest, profiles, fixtures, and YAML case suite.
- Adds 22 conformance cases covering core RPC/error behavior, session gating, framed binary handshakes, WebSocket JSON-RPC, events, streams, and capability metadata.
- Adds `tooling/scripts/validate-conformance.sh` and a `Validate conformance cases` CI workflow to validate case IDs, manifest references, profile coverage, schemas, and result shape.

### Migration

- No migration content changes from `spec/v0.0.2`.
- Existing legacy migration boundaries continue to apply.

### Runtime Impact

- Runtime/tool repositories should consume the shared `docs/conformance/` directory from the locked AXTP Spec checkout instead of defining their own case sources.
- Native runtime conformance runners should emit `conformance-results/result.json` using the shared result schema and explicitly report unsupported or skipped cases.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.0.2

Automation validation release for the AXTP Spec to runtime/tool upgrade flow.

### Protocol

- No protocol fact changes from `spec/v0.0.1`.
- Uses the current generated AXTP protocol snapshot to validate release artifact packaging.

### Registry

- No registry fact changes from `spec/v0.0.1`.
- Reuses the current method, event, error, capability, profile, and domain registry facts.

### Schemas

- No schema source changes from `spec/v0.0.1`.
- Reuses the current generated schema descriptors and metadata.

### Conformance

- Validates that the release workflow can build the Spec artifact and dispatch runtime/tool upgrades.
- Validates that runtime/tool repositories can regenerate artifacts from the released Spec tag.

### Migration

- No migration content changes from `spec/v0.0.1`.
- Reuses the current legacy classification and migration planning material.

### Runtime Impact

- Exercises the automatic `spec/v0.0.2` to runtime/tool `v0.0.2` synchronization path.
- Expected runtime/tool behavior is automated upgrade PR creation, generated manifest refresh, auto-merge after checks, `v0.0.2` tag creation, and GitHub Release creation.
- No npm, pub, PyPI, Docker, or runtime package registry publish is part of this Spec release.

## spec/v0.0.1

Initial tagged AXTP Spec release from the current repository snapshot.

### Protocol

- Publishes the current AXTP protocol specs as the first immutable Spec tag.
- Establishes AXTP v1 core wire documentation, transport profiles, RPC/CONTROL/STREAM specs, and compatibility/versioning guidance as the baseline documentation set.

### Registry

- Publishes current registry facts for core protocol metadata, RPC operations and encodings, control opcodes, errors, schemas, capabilities, profiles, and adopted domain registry entries.
- Keeps generated protocol facts sourced from `contract/registry/**/*.yaml` and `contract/registry/domains/**/*.yaml`.

### Schemas

- Publishes current generated schema descriptors and schema metadata for adopted AXTP methods, events, capabilities, and shared types.
- Keeps generated protocol outputs as machine-consumable artifacts derived from the YAML source facts.

### Conformance

- Publishes current generator tests, generated snapshots, and tooling test vectors as the baseline conformance material.
- Includes current C++/TypeScript/Flutter runtime generated references present in the repository snapshot.

### Migration

- Publishes current legacy classification and migration planning material for AXDP HID, Rooms, VM33, signage, firmware, and other legacy protocol mapping work.
- Keeps legacy compatibility behavior outside AXTP Core by documenting adapter and migration boundaries.

### Runtime Impact

- Establishes `spec/v0.0.1` as the first fixed AXTP Spec dependency target for runtime repositories.
- Runtime packages should record this tag through `AXTP_SPEC.lock.yaml` or package metadata instead of depending on `main`.
- No runtime package release is created by this Spec release.
