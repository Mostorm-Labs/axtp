description: Adopt reviewed AXTP docs/protocol domain-feature drafts into formal protocol governance docs and registry/domain YAML. Use when the user asks to approve, formalize, adopt, activate, land, or convert an already-reviewed AXTP protocol draft into specs 08-13 alignment and registry YAML facts. This stage fixes the draft as the formal accepted proposal but does not manually edit generated artifacts.

# Adopt Protocol Draft

Convert a reviewed AXTP protocol draft into formal protocol facts. This is the second workflow stage after `draft-business-protocol`: align the accepted proposal with `docs/specs/08-13`, freeze the draft as the formal proposal, and write the confirmed facts into YAML.

## Hard Boundaries

- Start from an existing `docs/protocol/<domain>/<domain.feature>.md` draft.
- Do not adopt drafts containing unresolved `[REVIEW-BLOCKER]`, `[REVIEW-FIX]`, or `[REVIEW-ASK]` facts unless the user provides exact confirmed facts and the adoption is scoped around them.
- Do not invent method/event/error/capability/profile semantics that are not present in the reviewed draft or specs.
- Do not edit `protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml`, `docs/generated/*`, `tooling/mcp/*`, `tooling/test-vectors/*`, `runtimes/*/generated/*`, or `runtimes/cpp-core/include/axtp/generated/*` by hand.
- Do not run full generated artifact emission as the main goal of this skill; use `generate-axtp-protocol` after adoption.
- New business features default to `registry/domains/<domain>/domain.yaml`.
- Use core `registry/` files only for Core/MVP adopted facts, shared schemas, core constants, profile governance, or accepted legacy mappings.
- Never duplicate the same method/event/error/schema/capability/profile in both core registry files and domain YAML.
- Preserve stable IDs, field IDs, `bit_offset`, and names.

## Required Evidence

Read enough local evidence to avoid guessing:

```text
docs/protocol/README.md
docs/protocol/<domain>/<domain.feature>.md
docs/specs/08-AXTP-Capability-Naming-and-Feature-Taxonomy.md
docs/specs/09-AXTP-Protocol-Definition-Mapping-Spec.md
docs/specs/10-AXTP-Methods-Registry-Spec.md
docs/specs/11-AXTP-Events-Registry-Spec.md
docs/specs/12-AXTP-Errors-Registry-Spec.md
docs/specs/13-AXTP-Types-and-Capability-Spec.md
docs/specs/14-AXTP-Profiles-Registry-Spec.md
docs/specs/17-AXTP-Schema-Field-Numbering.md
docs/specs/19-AXTP-Generator-v1实现规范.md
registry/**/*.yaml
registry/domains/**/*.yaml
docs/generated/protocol.md
protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml
```

For stream, OTA, transport-sensitive, or low-bandwidth features, also read specs 02-06 and 18. For legacy adoption, read cited legacy evidence under `docs/legacy-protocols/**`, `docs/migration/**`, or existing `registry/legacy/legacy_mapping.yaml`.

## Workflow

### 1. Confirm Draft Eligibility

Classify the draft:

| State | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Adopted | YAML/specs already fully cover it | Do not duplicate; report existing facts |
| Partially adopted | Some facts exist, draft adds reviewed gaps | Patch only missing confirmed facts |
| Ready for adoption | Draft has `[REVIEW-OK]` or equivalent confirmation and no unresolved blockers | Proceed |
| Not ready | Unresolved review markers, missing field shapes, unclear domain, or no review evidence | Stop and list blockers |

If a draft has mixed readiness, adopt only explicitly confirmed sections and leave unresolved sections in the report.

### 2. Extract Accepted Facts

Extract only confirmed facts:

- `domain.feature` and domain boundary
- capability names and capability type/schema
- methods, request schema, response schema, linked events, errors
- events and event schemas
- schemas, field names, field types, required/optional status, limits, descriptions
- domain-specific errors
- stream/profile additions
- concrete legacy mappings
- open questions that must remain out of specs/YAML

### 3. Align Specs 08-13

Reverse-confirm the accepted proposal into specs where needed:

| Spec | Confirm or update |
|---|---|
| 08 | domain.feature naming, method/event naming templates, feature taxonomy |
| 09 | domain placement, ID range, DomainId, bit offset, mapping to Protocol Definition |
| 10 | method registry rules or accepted method table references if the local spec pattern requires it |
| 11 | event registry rules or accepted event table references if needed |
| 12 | error code rules and domain-specific error placement |
| 13 | schema/type/capability rules and capability placement |

Do not turn specs into the machine fact source. Specs are governance and normative explanation; YAML remains the machine input.

### 4. Freeze The Draft As Formal Proposal

Update the draft only enough to record adoption:

- Mark accepted sections as `[REVIEW-OK]` or add an adoption note/table.
- Preserve unresolved sections as open questions and keep them out of YAML.
- Record that future unadopted facts must update the `docs/protocol` proposal first, then re-run adoption; already-adopted semantic changes must use `amend-adopted-protocol`.
- Do not remove useful review history unless it is misleading.

### 5. Choose YAML Targets

Use these defaults:

| Fact | Default target |
|---|---|
| New business method/event/schema/error/capability/profile | `registry/domains/<domain>/domain.yaml` |
| Core/MVP stable method/event/capability | `registry/method`, `registry/event`, or `registry/capability` only after governance confirmation |
| Shared schema used by multiple domains | `registry/schema/*.yaml` only if truly shared |
| Legacy mapping | `registry/legacy/legacy_mapping.yaml` only with concrete evidence |
| Core constants | `registry/core/*.yaml` only after spec change confirmation |

If no valid target exists, stop and report the required governance change.

### 6. Assign IDs And Bit Offsets

Compute from specs and existing YAML:

- Method IDs must be globally unique and in the correct domain range.
- Event IDs must be globally unique and in the correct domain range.
- Capability IDs and DomainId/Domain-Scoped Mask rules must follow specs 09 and 13.
- `bit_offset` must be unique within the domain and should remain contiguous unless existing YAML intentionally reserves gaps.
- New schema field IDs start from `0x01` in accepted field order unless explicitly specified.
- Existing schema field IDs must be preserved; append with the next safe ID.
- Prefer existing common errors before adding domain-specific errors.

Never reuse deprecated or stable values for different semantics.

### 7. Edit YAML Sources

Use `apply_patch`. Keep edits scoped to specs 08-13, the adopted draft, and chosen YAML sources.

Rules:

- Use source field names already used by the repo, such as `id`, `bit_offset`, `request_schema`, `response_schema`, and `event_schema`.
- Keep status as `draft` unless the draft and governance explicitly say MVP/stable.
- Preserve existing ordering patterns.
- Do not copy review prose, `[REVIEW-*]`, open questions, or `TBD` values into YAML.
- Do not create legacy mappings without concrete old values.

### 8. Validate Adoption Sources

Run source-level checks after specs/YAML edits:

```bash
pnpm --dir generators build
pnpm --dir generators test
pnpm --dir generators validate:sources
git diff --check
```

If pnpm dependency approval blocks scripts, use and report:

```bash
pnpm --dir generators --config.verify-deps-before-run=false build
pnpm --dir generators --config.verify-deps-before-run=false test
pnpm --dir generators --config.verify-deps-before-run=false validate:sources
git diff --check
```

Do not manually edit generated outputs in this skill. The next step is `generate-axtp-protocol`.

## Final Report

Report:

- Draft adopted and eligibility decision.
- Specs 08-13 files changed.
- Draft file changes and adoption marker.
- YAML source files changed.
- Assigned IDs, `bit_offset`, and schema field IDs.
- Open questions or skipped draft sections.
- Validation commands and results.
- Next step: run `docs/dev/skills/generate-axtp-protocol/SKILL.md`.
- Future post-adoption semantic changes must use `docs/dev/skills/amend-adopted-protocol/SKILL.md`.

If adoption is blocked, do not edit YAML. Report the exact blocker and the minimum draft/spec update needed.
