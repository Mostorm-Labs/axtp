name: amend-adopted-protocol
description: Amend already-adopted AXTP protocol facts after a reviewed draft has been formalized into specs, registry/domain YAML, and generated artifacts. Use when the user asks to modify, correct, remove, deprecate, rename, narrow, or extend a protocol method, event, schema field, error, capability, profile, or legacy mapping that is already adopted or generated.

# Amend Adopted Protocol

Change a protocol that has already passed adoption and entered YAML/generated artifacts. This workflow is for post-adoption corrections and semantic refinements, such as removing an unnecessary draft schema field, deprecating a stable field, renaming a generated type, or tightening an already-adopted method.

## Hard Boundaries

- Start from existing adopted facts in `docs/protocol/<domain>/<domain.feature>.md` plus `registry/**/*.yaml` or `registry/domains/**/*.yaml`.
- Do not infer new facts from generated files. Generated files are evidence of current output only.
- Do not hand-edit `protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml`, `docs/generated/*`, `tooling/mcp/*`, `tooling/test-vectors/*`, `runtimes/*/generated/*`, or `runtimes/cpp-core/include/axtp/generated/*`.
- Do not silently break `stable` or `mvp` wire contracts. For stable/MVP facts, prefer `deprecated`, optional additions, or versioned replacements over deletion or semantic mutation.
- Preserve IDs, `bitOffset`, field IDs, method/event names, and capability IDs for unchanged semantics.
- Do not reuse a removed/deprecated stable ID or field ID for a different meaning.
- If the requested change lacks exact confirmed facts, update the adopted draft with `[REVIEW-ASK]` / `[REVIEW-FIX]` only and do not patch YAML.
- Legacy mappings require concrete legacy command IDs, payload/status mapping evidence, and an explicit target method/field path.

## Required Evidence

Read only what is needed, but include enough evidence to avoid guessing:

```text
docs/protocol/README.md
docs/protocol/<domain>/<domain.feature>.md
docs/specs/08-AXTP-Capability-Naming-and-Feature-Taxonomy.md
docs/specs/09-AXTP-Protocol-Definition-Mapping-Spec.md
docs/specs/10-AXTP-Methods-Registry-Spec.md
docs/specs/11-AXTP-Events-Registry-Spec.md
docs/specs/12-AXTP-Errors-Registry-Spec.md
docs/specs/13-AXTP-Types-and-Capability-Spec.md
docs/specs/14-AXTP-Profiles-Registry-Spec.md
docs/specs/17-AXTP-Schema-Field-Numbering.md
docs/specs/19-AXTP-Generator-v1实现规范.md
registry/**/*.yaml
registry/domains/**/*.yaml
protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml
docs/generated/protocol.md
```

For stream, OTA, transport-sensitive, or low-bandwidth changes, also read specs 02-06 and 18.

## Workflow

### 1. Confirm Amendment Eligibility

Classify the target before editing:

| State | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Not adopted | Draft has no YAML/generated fact yet | Route to `draft-business-protocol` or `adopt-protocol-draft` |
| Adopted draft/experimental | Facts are adopted but not stable/MVP | Direct source amendment may be allowed after exact confirmation |
| Adopted stable/MVP | Wire contract is stable or required | Deprecate/version/add optional replacement; do not hard-delete |
| Generated-only mismatch | YAML is correct but generated output is stale | Route to `generate-axtp-protocol` |
| Unclear request | Missing exact field/method/semantic decision | Stop or update draft with `[REVIEW-ASK]`; do not patch YAML |

Report the eligibility decision before broad edits.

### 2. Capture Confirmed Change Facts

Extract only explicit facts from the user request and adopted draft:

- target `domain.feature`
- target method/event/type/capability/error/profile/legacy mapping
- fields to add, remove, deprecate, rename, or narrow
- whether existing status is `draft`, `experimental`, `mvp`, `stable`, or `deprecated`
- compatibility intent: breaking correction, deprecation, versioned replacement, or optional extension
- rationale and review source
- open questions that must remain out of YAML

Example: removing `mode` from draft audio algorithm schemas is a draft-field removal. If the same field were stable, the safer action would be deprecation or a versioned schema/method.

### 3. Choose Compatibility Action

Use this table:

| Change | draft/experimental | stable/mvp |
|---|---|---|
| Remove unnecessary optional field | May delete from draft, YAML, and generated output | Mark deprecated or keep ignored; do not reuse field ID |
| Remove required field | Allowed only with explicit breaking correction confirmation | Version the schema/method or keep field optional/deprecated |
| Rename field or method | Prefer replace before broad use; preserve semantics only if name is not wire-visible | Add new name/version and deprecate old |
| Narrow enum/range | Allowed if confirmed and not shipped | Treat as breaking; add version or compatibility rule |
| Add optional field | Append next safe field ID | Append next safe field ID |
| Change method/event/capability ID | Do not change unless fact was never generated and is explicitly corrected | Never change; allocate a new ID |

When removing draft fields, field IDs may disappear from draft YAML. When deprecating stable fields, keep the field entry with `deprecated: true` and do not reuse the field ID.

### 4. Update Adopted Proposal

Patch `docs/protocol/<domain>/<domain.feature>.md` first:

- Add or update an `## Amendment History` / `## 修订记录` section.
- Record date, change summary, rationale, compatibility decision, and YAML targets.
- Remove or update stale examples, parameter tables, acceptance criteria, and registry notes.
- Keep unresolved or deferred facts as `[REVIEW-ASK]`; do not move them to YAML.
- Preserve useful adoption history.

### 5. Update Specs 08-13/14 Only Where Needed

Specs are governance, not the machine source. Update only when the amendment changes:

- domain.feature naming or method/event template guidance
- formal method/event/capability planning tables
- schema/type/capability rules
- error placement or domain-specific error tables
- field numbering/deprecation guidance
- profile membership, MVP requirements, or profile registry semantics

Do not copy full business prose into specs.

### 6. Patch YAML Sources

Patch `registry/**/*.yaml` or `registry/domains/**/*.yaml` with `apply_patch`.

Rules:

- Edit the existing source of truth; do not duplicate the same fact in core and domain YAML.
- Preserve unchanged IDs, `bitOffset`, field IDs, names, and statuses.
- Append new field IDs in accepted order.
- Remove draft-only fields only when confirmed and not stable/MVP.
- Deprecate stable/MVP fields instead of deleting.
- Update method request/response/event schema references if a type is renamed or versioned.
- Keep generated outputs untouched until the generator runs.

### 7. Validate Sources

Run:

```bash
pnpm --dir generators build
pnpm --dir generators test
pnpm --dir generators validate:sources
git diff --check
```

If pnpm dependency approval blocks scripts, use and report:

```bash
pnpm --dir generators --config.verify-deps-before-run=false build
pnpm --dir generators --config.verify-deps-before-run=false test
pnpm --dir generators --config.verify-deps-before-run=false validate:sources
git diff --check
```

If source validation fails, fix source YAML or specs alignment before generating.

### 8. Regenerate Artifacts

After source validation passes, run the generator stage:

```bash
pnpm --dir generators generate
pnpm --dir generators validate:protocol
git diff --check
```

If pnpm dependency approval blocks scripts, use:

```bash
pnpm --dir generators --config.verify-deps-before-run=false generate
pnpm --dir generators --config.verify-deps-before-run=false validate:protocol
git diff --check
```

If tests fail because snapshots intentionally changed, inspect the diff and update snapshots with the repo's Vitest snapshot workflow only after confirming the generated output matches the amended YAML facts.

### 9. Verify Output Coverage

Use targeted `rg` or JSON checks to confirm:

- removed facts no longer appear in protocol IR/generated docs when removal was intended
- deprecated facts remain visible with deprecation metadata when deprecation was intended
- new or replacement facts appear in `protocol/axtp.protocol.yaml`, `docs/generated/protocol.md`, MCP JSON, C++ generated headers, and snapshots
- generated files changed only through the generator

## Final Report

Report:

- amendment target and eligibility decision
- confirmed change facts and compatibility action
- proposal/spec/YAML files changed
- generated files changed by Generator
- IDs, `bitOffset`, field IDs preserved, removed, deprecated, or newly assigned
- open questions or skipped sections
- validation and generation commands with results

If blocked, report the exact missing confirmation and the minimum draft/spec/YAML decision needed.
